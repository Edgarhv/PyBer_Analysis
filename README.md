### Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this Module is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. We understood the metrics of the Pyber ride. Also, using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, we create the visualization. This report will include multiple-line graphs.

### Results

 ##### • Urban cities have the highest ridership demand and they have more drivers than suburban cities.
 ##### • Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
 ##### •	Suburban cities have more drivers than rural with almost double revenue.
 
 The table above shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.
